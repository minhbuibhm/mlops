# MLOps
## 1. Introducion to Machine Learning in Production.
### (a) What MLOps is, get used to 4 stages in MLOps: Scoping, Data, Modeling, Deploying
### (b) Understanding concept/data drift
### (c) Understanding tasks inside 4 stages and how each task deal with problems during deploying ML in production
### (d) Try deploying on local the model (YOLOv3) using fastAPI

## 2. Machine Learning Data Lifecycle in Production: Understanding and implementing data pipeline with TFX
### (i) colleting and labeling data
### (ii) ingesting data
### (iii) generating statistics
### (iv) generating schema; validating anomalies
### (v) transforming (preprocessing and feature selection)
