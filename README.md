# MLOps
## 1. Introducion to Machine Learning in Production.
- What MLOps is, get used to 4 stages in MLOps: Scoping, Data, Modeling, Deploying.
- Understanding concept/data drift.
- Understanding tasks inside 4 stages and how each task deal with problems during deploying ML in production.
- Try deploying on local the model (YOLOv3) using fastAPI.

## 2. Machine Learning Data Lifecycle in Production: Understanding and implementing data pipeline with TFX.
- colleting and labeling data.
- ingesting data.
- generating statistics.
- generating schema; validating anomalies.
- transforming (preprocessing and feature selection).

## 3. Machine Learning Modeling Pipelines in Production (Progress: 1/5)
- try using AutoML, get used to gloud bucket and some APIs.
- ...
